# PRODIGY_CS_04
## Overview

This project showcases how to create a basic keylogger using Python and the `pynput` library. A keylogger is a program designed to record and log keystrokes made by a user. This program focuses on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file.

## Important Note

Ethical considerations and permissions are essential for projects involving keyloggers. Unauthorized use of keyloggers to capture sensitive information without explicit consent is illegal and unethical. This program is intended for educational purposes only. Always ensure you have explicit permission to use keylogging tools.
